## About Projects

- Visualizations were made for Project 1 and Project 2, adhering to the instructions given in the course. These visualizations were prepared according to the conditions I prepared in accordance with the dataset.
- Project 1 was prepared as Code via Tableau. Alternatively, PowerBI can also be selected.
- Project 2 was created with Python code from Colab. You can also review the questions and outcomes in the reports.

I wish everyone good luck.

I also leave the Google Colab files of the project <a>[here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicansariboga/)<a/>. You can easily benefit from this binding.
